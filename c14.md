*__Package Management__*

-----

While working on some code, you notice that you need a certain library to implement a feature for your application. You venture onto the internet and find out that the generous developers have made a Github repo for you to compile the source code by yourself. Though this looks like a good idea, it can become pretty annoying _(for the lack of a better word)_ everytime you need to add a new library using __almost__ the same commands for compiling the code. This workflow does not include finding and installing all the dependencies and then compiling those too, which is another frustrating experience if some errors or incompatibility appears.

Well, every Linux distro comes with a pre-installed __package manager__ that handles all the above steps using a much more simpler set of commands. Package management is a method of installing and maintaining software on the system.

Package managers are primarily classified as __low-level__ and __high-level__. The former deals with installing and removing packages whereas the latter deals with metadata searching, dependency resolving and much more.

Example, I am using a Kali Linux environment which is based on Debian. Debian comes pre-packaged with `apt` and `dpkg` package management tools. `apt` is a high-level package manager whereas `dpkg` is its low-level counterpart.

`apt` provides users to search for packages whereas `dpkg` requires you to have a _`package file`_<sup>_1_</sup> which most probably is provided by the package maintainer _somewhere._<sup>_2_</sup>

<sup>_1_</sup>_But what is a package file?_

A package file is just a compressed version of the original package files. These also include metadata, pre- and post-configuration scripts that are needed by the package manager to ensure that the package works as expected out-of-the-box.

<sup>_2_</sup>_Where?_

Most of the time, these packages are indexed to the official repositories of different Linux distros. _([Kali has one too](http://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-rolling/))_. These repositories have packages distributed in different packaging systems. There are two major packaging system: _.deb_ and _.rpm_. [This answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/103531/what-are-deb-and-rpm-and-how-are-they-different-from-msi) explains the difference in packaging styles very well.

Most probably, the man pages of the package manager packaged onto your system are pretty good for learning about the different commands they support.
