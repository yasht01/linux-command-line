*__A Gentle Introduction to vi__*

-----

__Preface__: This is a really gentle introduction. [Vim Documentation](https://www.vim.org/docs.php) is a much more rigorous reference for vi.

`vi` is a text editor that is a part of the POSIX standard and hence is available in every Linux distro that you use. It is lightweight and fast as its primary motive was good typing speed and efficient commands. Nowadays, `vi` has been sustituted by `vim` and all old references are symbolically linked to `vim` command in `/usr/bin/`.


There are 3 primary modes while using Vim:

- __INSERT__ mode - appending or inserting text happens here
- __NORMAL__ mode - this is mode that you will remain in most of the time. 
- __VISUAL__ mode - used for copying and pasting sections of text
- __COMMAND__ mode - used for search and filter commands.

> One caveat is that the __NORMAL__ mode and __COMMAND__ mode are same. The only difference is all commands used in COMMAND mode are prefixed by `:`.

There are a lot of commands that exist in these modes and mentioning them here will be redundant and realistically, a waste of time. These resources will be much more helpful:

_PS: I really liked Anish's advice to use Vim bindings on every software I use. Though that's a stretch, I will try [Vim bindings on VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) and update on my experience in a week._
