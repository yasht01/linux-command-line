*__Text Processing__*

---

_Preface: This chapter mostly comprises of explaining some possible use cases that the author tells will be useful in Part 4 where we will have a look at Bash scrpting. Thus, I will be mentioning just a few flags or a short definition of below commands. The link in Useful Links has cheatsheets for learning more about them._

This chapter will revisit some old friends and introduce us to some new ones:
- `cat` – Concatenate files and print on the standard output
- `sort` – Sort lines of text files
- `uniq` – Report or omit repeated lines
- `cut` – Remove sections from each line of files
- `paste` – Merge lines of files
- `join` – Join lines of two files on a common field
- `comm` – Compare two sorted files line by line
- `diff` – Compare files line by line
- `patch` – Apply a diff file to an original
- `tr` – Translate or delete characters
- `sed` – Stream editor for filtering and transforming text
- `aspell` – Interactive spell checker

- `cat`: has a few interesting flags:

  - `-A`: displays hidden ASCII characters like `/n` to standard output.
  - `-n`: displays line numbers for files to standard output.

- `sort`: used to sort contents of standard input and sends the results to standard output.

  - `-r`: sort in reverse order.
  - `-k`: sort on the basis of a field name.
  - `-t`: specify a field seperator character.

- `uniq`: removes any duplicate
lines and sends the results to standard output.

- `cut`: extract a section of text from a line and output the extracted section to standard output.

- `paste`: adds one or more columns of text to a file. It does this by reading multiple files and combining the fields found in each file into a single stream on standard output.

`comm`: used to compare two files and display sections of same text and different text to standard output. comm produces three columns of output. The first column contains lines
unique to the first file argument; the second column, the lines unique to the second file argument; the third column contains the lines shared by both files.

### Pretty Neat commands:

- `tr`: performs character-based search-and-replace operation to standard input. 
  - `echo "lowercase letters" | tr a-z A-Z` here the standard input is converted from lowercase (`a-z`) to uppercase (`A-Z`)
  - `echo "aaabbbccc" | tr -s ab` outputs `abccc` is a _squeeze_ operation in some sense.

- `sed`: performs text editing on a stream of text, either a set of specified files or standard input.

  - `echo "front" | sed 's/front/back/'` _substitutes_ every instance of `front` to `back`. Adding a number to `s` like `2s` replaces the n _th_ instance given word.
  - `sed` supports regular expressions as well giving a range for substituting given text.
