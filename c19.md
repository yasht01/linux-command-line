*__Regular Expressions__*

---

_Preface: I hate this topic and most of the time you might use regex, [this site](https://regex101.com) will be much more helpful than remembering the syntax for regular expressions. Also, this chapter has a lot of tidbits about some Unix terms and standards you might have heard about._

The book only talks about regex supported by `grep` command and I found out that all programs support variations of regex.

Regular expressions are symbolic notations used to identify patterns in text. Not all regular expressions are the same; they vary slightly from tool to tool and from programming language to language.

`grep` allows to search for patterns using the below syntax:
`grep [options] regex [file...]`

In regex terms, the characters in a string are called literal characters and metacharacters consist of the following:

`^ $ . [ ] { } - ? * + ( ) | \`

The dot or period character is used to
match any character. The caret `^` and dollar sign `$` characters are treated as anchors in regular expressions.
This means that they cause the match to occur only if the regular expression is found at
the beginning of the line `^` or at the end of the line `$`. In addition to matching any character at a given position in our regular expression, we
can also match a single character from a specified set of characters by using bracket expressions.

Example: `grep -h '[bg]zip' dirlist*.txt`
Here, we match any line that contains the string “bzip” or “gzip".

If the first character in a bracket expression is a caret `^`, the remaining characters are
taken to be a set of characters that must not be present at the given character position.

Similarily giving a character range using `-`, for example `grep -h '[A-Z]' dirlist*.txt`
This will match every filename containing an uppercase letter.

There exist two different types of POSIX Regular Expressions: Basic and Extended. 

Basic: `^ $ . [ ] *`

Extended: `( ) { } ? + |`

`?` - Match an element zero or one time

`*` - Match an element zero or more times

`+` - Match an element one or more times

`{}` - Match an element a specific number of times

_Story behind POSIX and IEEE_

During the 1980’s, Unix became a very popular commercial operating system, but
by 1988, the Unix world was in turmoil. Many computer manufacturers had licensed the Unix source code from its creators, AT&T, and were supplying various
versions of the operating system with their systems. However, in their efforts to
create product differentiation, each manufacturer added proprietary changes and
extensions. This started to limit the compatibility of the software. As always with
proprietary vendors, each was trying to play a winning game of “lock-in” with
their customers. This dark time in the history of Unix is known today as “the
Balkanization.”
Enter the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). In the mid1980s, the IEEE began developing a set of standards that would define how Unix
(and Unix-like) systems would perform. These standards, formally known as
IEEE 1003, define the application programming interfaces (APIs), shell and utilities that are to be found on a standard Unix-like system. The name “POSIX,”
which stands for Portable Operating System Interface (with the “X” added to the
end for extra snappiness), was suggested by Richard Stallman (yes, that Richard
Stallman), and was adopted by the IEEE.
