*__Storage Media__*

-----

Linux kernel is capable of handling storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, flash drives, CD-ROMs as well as virtual storage devices such as RAID and LVM.

Since Linux's core philosophy is `everything is a file`, a device is attached to the system as a file in a file system tree. This process is called mounting and allows the operating system to use this device.

You can view the devices in the `/etc/fstab` file. The file has a table having 6 columns describing the device, mount point, file system type, options, frequency and order. Most of these columns are self-explainable except frequency which describes whether and when a device files are backed up and order describes the order in which `fsck` checks the devices for integrity issues.

The devices can be mounted to the system tree using the `mount` command and unmounted using `umount` command. There are a lot of options for `mount` command which can be checked on its man page.

Unmounting devices is important. The reason is a bit long but, here is the short version. The operating system uses buffers residing on the RAM for data operations on devices. This is due to the fact that the devices work at a rate slower than that of a processor. Thus, to save time and increase efficiency of the processor, the data for these operations are stored onto the buffer which perform these operations at the device speed saving the processor's time. __Unmounting__ a device completes all the above operations before removing it from the file system tree. Not unmounting and removing the device physically can lead to file system corruption is many cases.

Exploring the `/` folders, you can look into all the devices connected to the system in the `/dev` folder. You can see there exists `sda_` named files in this folder. These are the SCSI devices that are block-level devices that perform data operations in units of blocks. HDD or SSD is one example of SCSI devices. You might also notice `sda1`, `sda2` and many more which point to the partitions on the a _th_ SCSI device.

Just for more clarity:
s->*__S__* CSI

d->*__D__* evice

a->Label `a`

1 ->`1st partition`

You can modify these partitions using `fdisk` or creating a file system on the device using `mkfs`. The partitions can also be tested for integrity errors and repair them using `fsck` command.

`dd` command is useful for block-by-block copy of your device to another location.
