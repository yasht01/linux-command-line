This chapter is solely focused on finding files in a Linux system.

- `locate`: performs a rapid database search of pathnames, and then outputs
every name that matches a given substring. The locate program has been around for a number of years, and there are several different variants in common use. The two most common ones found in modern Linux distributions are slocate and mlocate, though they are usually accessed by a symbolic link named locate. The locate database is created by another program named updatedb. Usually, it is run periodically as a cron job; that is, a task performed at regular intervals by the cron daemon.

- `find`: While the locate program can find a file based solely on its name, the find program
searches a given directory (and its subdirectories) for files based on a variety of attributes. There are a lot of options and operators that `find` provides for more customisation of the results. It also provides `-exec` flag to perform commands on the output received from the `find` command.

Syntax: `find <pathname> <options> <operator>`

Here, the pathname can relative or absolute, options allow customisation in the search and operators allow combining different options together. (`-and`, `-or` and `-not`)
