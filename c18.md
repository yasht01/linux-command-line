*__Archiving and Backup__*

---

The primary motive for archiving and backing up files is to store copies of data in as small space as possible with or without any loss of data.

Data compression is the process of removing _redundancy_ from data. Letâ€™s consider an
imaginary example. Say we had an entirely black picture file with the dimensions of 100
pixels by 100 pixels. You might see that this file can be represented using a simple data structure that has the dimensions of the pictures with another integer giving the hex value of the color stored in every cell of the 100 x 100 matrix. 

Compression algorithms perform operations that remove these redundancies using different approaches to compressing the data.

There are two primary programs `gzip` and `bzip2` used for compressing data. The only difference is the compression algorithms they used underneath. Files compressed using `gzip` and `bzip2` can be uncompressed using `gunzip` and `bunzip2` commands. The compressed files can be directly viewed without decompressing using `zcat` or `zless`, which are based of `cat` and `less` commands.

A common file-management task often used in conjunction with compression is archiving. Archiving is the process of gathering up many files and bundling them together into a
single large file. Archiving is often done as a part of system backups. It is also used when
old data is moved from a system to some type of long-term storage. `tar` command is used for archiving files or folders. The man pages of tar explain all the flags supported by `tar`.

`zip` command combines archiving and compressing files using its supported flags. `unzip` command decompresses `zip` files. The `zip` command supports displaying contents of the archive using the `-p` flag which pipes the output to a program of your choice. 

A common strategy for maintaining a backup copy of a system involves keeping one or
more directories synchronized with another directory (or directories) located on either the
local system (usually a removable storage device of some kind) or a remote system. 

In the Unix-like world, the preferred tool for this task is rsync. This program can synchronize both local and remote directories by using the rsync remote-update protocol, which allows rsync to quickly detect the differences between two directories and perform the minimum amount of copying required to bring them into sync. Though remote to remote copy of files is not supported by `rsync`.

Command syntax: `rsync options source destination`
