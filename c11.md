*__The Environment__*

___

The shell stores two different types of variables in an environment, conveniently called shell and environment variables. These variables can be used as a data store for different purposes ranging from storing specific program related variables required while running a program inside a terminal to providing a path for the terminal to look into when a keyword<sup>_1_</sup> is invoked.

`Shell variables` are variables placed by the terminal installed on your Linux distro and all the other variables are `environment variables`. Conveniently, these variables can be viewed using `printenv` and `set` command respectively. 

`printenv` is solely meant for displaying all or specific environment variables.


`printenv` - will list all the environment variables


`printenv {VARIABLE_NAME}` will list the key value pair of `VARIABLE_NAME` env variable.

`set` command though has a lot more to offer and the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/set.1p.html) is a very good resource for understanding more, though [this](https://tldr.ostera.io/set) will be much more simple to understand.

_Tip: Try modifying the `PS1` attribute using any text editor and then reloading the shell to see the changes._<sup>_2_</sup>

But how do these variable get loaded onto the terminal?
There are _startup files_ located in the filesystem that are configuration scripts that run on startup and load the variables to the shell. But, the order differs based on the type of shell session. The login shell session (_your login screen_) has a different order to a non-login shell session (_the one installed on your desktop environment_) for looking for the variables 

Login shell - `/etc/profile` -> `~/.bash_profile` -> `~/.bash_login` -> `~/.profile`

Non-login shell - `/etc/bash.bashrc` -> `~/.bashrc`

> Files higher in order above are looked first. `/etc/profile` will be loaded first as it is present on every Linux distro on install.

The startup files can be edited and loaded onto the terminal using `source {FILE_NAME}` . __One point to note__ is that startup files are a bunch of commands understood by your terminal interpreter so the syntax will be same as used on the terminal window.

[2]: _Do __make a backup of the original file__ or you might break your terminal prompt._

Bunch of resources I found really helpful:

- [export command](ttps://tldr.ostera.io/export) - One caveat is the variables assigned using export command remain until the current environment is running. Thus, certain variables that you might need to use without using `export` command every time you load a new terminal session can be exported inside the above mentioned startup files.

- [INVOCATION section of bash man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#INVOCATION) - for understanding more about login and non-login shell sessions.
